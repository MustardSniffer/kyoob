Kyoob - XNA Voxel Engine
========================

For some reason I've always wanted to make a voxel engine, so I decided that
I was going to finally start writing one. This is the result.

Dependencies
------------

* [XNA 4.0 Refresh](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27599)
  * [See here](http://what-ev.net/2014/02/19/the-xna-enabler-app-xna-in-visual-studio-2012-2013/)
    if you're using VS2012 or VS2013
  * I have no clue if this will work with MonoGame
* [LibNoise for .NET](https://libnoisedotnet.codeplex.com/)
